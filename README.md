# Hey Kivi — semantic memory

Technical implementation plan for the Sarvam Golden Goose assignment. Target review: **12 September 2026, afternoon IST**. Primary delivery method: a local application and PostgreSQL database through Docker Compose; hosted model inference may require provider credentials and network access.

**Current state: planning only.** This restart contains documentation and repository hygiene files. The application, database schema, importer, model adapters, CLI, UI and evaluations described here are not implemented. There are no measured product results yet.

The proposed demonstration imports a person's dictations, answers questions or prepares a contextual draft from supported history, and exposes Sources, Correct, Forget and Private. Backend/database/CLI development comes first; a small ordinary-user interface is part of the required result.

## Starting a fresh implementation chat

Use this implementation repository as the project folder. The user's updated workflow is a fresh discussion chat for understanding the PDF, resolving doubts and reviewing tradeoffs, followed by Codex CLI for approved implementation work. Application processes still run in the verified Docker Linux environment. The CLI's Windows-versus-WSL location, configuration, authentication and repository access must be checked before coding there; Docker readiness does not verify CLI setup. Keep one active checkout. The repository files carry the working context; each chat/session should read them rather than assume it has the previous conversation.

At handoff, environment readiness is verified and the application is unimplemented. S03 bootstrap is the next proposed scope and still needs the user's approval for important code/schema changes. The test → update todo.md → commit → push workflow is already authorized. Final independent Part One documents and live-model credentials/settings/budget remain open. The two chat-generated [Part One drafts](docs/part-one/README.md#ai-assisted-drafts-supplied-in-chat) are preserved as AI-assisted reference only.

Suggested discussion-chat starting message:

> Read the visual PDF and the repository's AGENTS.md, todo.md, README.md, DECISIONS.md, PLAN.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, EVALUATION.md and RUN.md. Help me understand the diagrams and compare alternatives using page/node IDs. Record agreed decisions in the Markdown files. Review the bounded S03 bootstrap scope with me and prepare a clear instruction for Codex CLI once I approve it. Preserve documented open items and distinguish proposed behavior from verified results.

Suggested CLI handoff, after scope approval:

> Read AGENTS.md and the planning documents linked by README.md. Check the actual Git state, approved scope and CLI/Docker access. Implement only the approved milestone through shared services. Run relevant checks, update todo.md, commit, push and verify the remote result. Ask before material changes outside the approved scope. Do not treat an AI-assisted Part One draft, environment probe or mock model as completed submission or product evidence.

## Using the visual guide

The PDF is a diagram-only companion: short labels inside shapes, a consistent role-color legend, named decision branches, and the same Atlas/Mira examples across pages. Use identifiers such as **09.D** (candidate union) or **14.H** (reply-release guard) when asking questions. Its page-map cards and MAP links navigate within the PDF; page footers link to the current supporting Markdown file on GitHub.

The diagram snapshot is dated 11 September 2026, based on planning checkpoint `557d1ce` plus the user's subsequent discussion-chat/CLI workflow choice. It depicts requirements and proposed behavior, with explicit status tags. It does not change the application architecture, close S01, approve S03 or provide measured product results. Markdown and tested code remain the precise, evolving implementation record.

To regenerate the PDF with Python and ReportLab installed, run `python tools/build_visual_guide.py` from the repository root. It writes the PDF under `output/pdf/` and temporary layout metadata under `tmp/pdfs/`. Generation was checked with ReportLab 4.4.9 and the output rendered with Poppler for visual review. This script is documentation tooling, separate from the still-unimplemented application.

The following supporting resources remain in the **parent planning workspace**, outside this Git repository. These paths are relative to the current implementation checkout. They are not automatically present in a fresh clone or isolated worktree; use the original planning workspace to access them. The implementation decisions and acceptance gates are already consolidated in this repository.

| Supporting material | Existing location |
| --- | --- |
| Assignment brief and extracted text | `../reference/Kivi_Golden_Goose_Task_Final.pdf` and `.txt` |
| Eight synthetic source observations | `../reference-examples/sample-dictations.jsonl` |
| Separate evaluator questions/labels | `../reference-examples/sample-evaluation-cases.json` — never ingest as memory |
| Deeper implementation research | `../research/implementation-strategy.md`, `implementation-evaluation.md`, `implementation-models.md` |
| Educational memory blueprint | `../kivi-memory-blueprint.html` |

Bring the synthetic fixtures into the repository during the approved test-data/import slice and verify their contents. These existing eight observations do not satisfy the approximately 500-observation corpus requirement. The course and research artifacts are background references, not product implementation or measured results.

## Proposed starting stack

| Need | Technology | Why this is enough initially |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Consistent runtime | Ubuntu 24.04 / WSL2, Docker Compose, containerized Python 3.12 | A Linux execution path without changing host Python or requiring deployment. |
| HTTP API and typed boundaries | FastAPI, Pydantic, HTTPX | Small API, validated request/model output contracts and a provider adapter. |
| State and retrieval | PostgreSQL + pgvector; built-in full-text search | One database for sources, claims, revisions, jobs and searchable views. Exact vectors before ANN. |
| DB access and schema changes | SQLAlchemy, psycopg, Alembic | Explicit transactions and reproducible migrations. |
| Developer/reviewer CLI | Typer calling the same application services | Import, process, inspect, ask, evaluate and reset without duplicated business rules. |
| Reproducible checks | pytest, HTTPX test client, Ruff, locked dependencies with uv | Cheap contract tests plus separately identified real-model evaluation. |
| Ordinary-user surface | Small HTML/CSS/JavaScript client | Import/status, Ask, Sources and memory controls; richer UI is optional. |

Versions above are candidate major versions, not a resolved dependency lock. Bootstrap must pin compatible packages and image digests. No Redis, separate vector service, graph cluster, autonomous memory framework or Kubernetes is required for the first implementation.

## What must be demonstrated

1. Original records become selective, source-supported memories; raw and formatted variants stay one observation.
2. Information spread across dictations can support a useful answer or draft with citations.
3. Changed facts, tentative statements and conflicting evidence produce different behavior.
4. Correct changes later use; Forget prevents retrieval and relearning; Private neither reads saved personal data nor persists activity.
5. A reviewer can import an unfamiliar corpus, inspect actual state, operate the UI and reproduce evaluation.

Approximately 500 development observations and a separate reviewer corpus of approximately 500 are required. Eight synthetic Atlas examples in the planning workspace are the starting diagnostic cases, not the complete dataset. DeepSeek is selected for the main model role; [the current shortlist](ARCHITECTURE.md#models-and-repair) compares NVIDIA Nemotron Lightning and Qwen3-8B for memory proposals. Exact model performance, provider access, spend ceiling and retention settings must be verified before live calls.

## History, evidence and AI use

Commit `596b034` replaced the earlier repository contents with a focused planning baseline. Prior commits remain reachable through normal Git history. After each meaningful milestone, run relevant checks, update [todo.md](todo.md), commit and push the completed work. Neither timestamps nor results should be manufactured to suggest progress.

These technical documents were prepared with AI assistance, including explainer agents, source research and review. The assignment's **Part One positioning and vision must be independently formed and written by the applicant and preserved before Part Two**. The applicant's supplied [source notes](docs/part-one/README.md) are preserved with provenance and counts; two final submissions have not been identified. These technical documents do not fulfill Part One. Do not generate replacement positioning or vision text.

Azure is an optional final experiment after the local review path passes. It is not a dependency of submission. The architecture and evaluation are hypotheses to test, not claims of a best-performing memory system.
