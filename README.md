# Hey Kivi — semantic memory

Technical implementation plan for the Sarvam Golden Goose assignment. Target review: **12 September 2026, afternoon IST**. Primary delivery method: a local application and PostgreSQL database through Docker Compose; hosted model inference may require provider credentials and network access.

**Current state: an integrated synthetic prototype.** The browser supports import, source inspection, Search, processing, Memories/history, Ask with citations, Correct, Record a change, Forget, feedback diagnosis and Private clearing. API, optional CLI, workers and evaluators share the same backend services. Live NVIDIA use is approved only for exact public fixtures, with a persisted ceiling of 96 requests / 1,500,000 total tokens including retries and $0 paid. A working transport or a passing contract test does not establish model accuracy. See [current S09 results and limitations](RUN.md#s09-controls-and-synthetic-ask) before testing live inference.

The proposed demonstration imports a person's dictations, answers questions or prepares a contextual draft from supported history, and exposes Sources, Correct, Forget and Private. The minimal browser interface is now the primary review surface; further backend milestones must connect their user actions there.

## Starting a fresh implementation chat

Use this implementation repository as the project folder. The user's updated workflow is a fresh discussion chat for understanding the PDF, resolving doubts and reviewing tradeoffs, followed by Codex CLI for approved implementation work. Application processes still run in the verified Docker Linux environment. The CLI's Windows-versus-WSL location, configuration, authentication and repository access must be checked before coding there; Docker readiness does not verify CLI setup. Keep one active checkout. The repository files carry the working context; each chat/session should read them rather than assume it has the previous conversation.

Implementation continues on `dev`; the user controls subsequent merges into `main`. The latest instruction approves synthetic-only NVIDIA calls and S09 controls, alongside completing the missing Ask baseline. The current acceptance record is in [RUN.md](RUN.md#s09-controls-and-synthetic-ask); [todo.md](todo.md) distinguishes implemented workflows from open live-quality gates. The 18-page PDF remains a historical design snapshot. Final Part One documents remain with the applicant and have not been mechanically checked here; the preserved AI-assisted drafts retain separate provenance.

Suggested discussion-chat starting message:

> Read the visual PDF and the repository's AGENTS.md, todo.md, README.md, DECISIONS.md, PLAN.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, EVALUATION.md and RUN.md. Help me understand the diagrams and compare alternatives using page/node IDs. Record agreed decisions in the Markdown files. Review the next bounded milestone in todo.md with me and prepare a clear instruction for Codex CLI once I approve it. Preserve documented open items and distinguish proposed behavior from verified results.

Suggested CLI handoff, after scope approval:

> Read AGENTS.md and the planning documents linked by README.md. Check the actual Git state, approved scope and CLI/Docker access. Implement only the approved milestone through shared services. Run relevant checks, update todo.md, commit, push and verify the remote result. Ask before material changes outside the approved scope. Do not treat an AI-assisted Part One draft, environment probe or mock model as completed submission or product evidence.

## Using the visual guide

The PDF is a visual companion: short labels inside shapes, a consistent role-color legend, named decision branches, and the same Atlas/Mira examples across pages. Use identifiers such as **09.D** (candidate union) or **14.H** (reply-release guard) when asking questions. Its page-map cards and MAP links navigate within the PDF; every page ends with three clickable reference cards and its supporting Markdown link. The [source register](docs/visual-guide-references.md) records exact brief locators, page-by-page references and evidence limits. Page 2 explicitly maps the assignment's broad term to our included facts, preferences and useful episodes; automatic procedural learning is deferred.

The diagram snapshot is dated 11 September 2026, revised from visual-guide checkpoint `3eca8fb` to clarify the existing episodic scope and add verified references. Repository reference cards follow `dev`; page 18 records assistant commits to `dev` and user-controlled merges to `main`. It depicts requirements and proposed behavior, with explicit status tags. It does not change the application architecture, close S01, approve S03 or provide measured product results. Markdown and tested code remain the precise, evolving implementation record.

The S06 readiness audit reviewed all 18 pages against the implemented boundaries. DeepSeek labels and pending implementation statuses in the PDF are historical. S09 now implements the controls/feedback path from pages 12–15 and connects Ask to the browser. PostgreSQL tests establish lifecycle and privacy contracts; actual live results and unresolved quality gates are recorded separately. [Current workflow and evidence](RUN.md#s09-controls-and-synthetic-ask)

To regenerate the PDF with Python and ReportLab installed, run `python tools/build_visual_guide.py` from the repository root. It writes the PDF under `output/pdf/`, regenerates `docs/visual-guide-references.md` from `tools/visual_guide_sources.py`, and writes temporary layout metadata under `tmp/pdfs/`. Generation was checked with ReportLab 4.4.9 and the output rendered with Poppler for visual review. This script is documentation tooling, separate from the S03 backend.

The following supporting resources remain in the **parent planning workspace**, outside this Git repository. These paths are relative to the current implementation checkout. They are not automatically present in a fresh clone or isolated worktree; use the original planning workspace to access them. The implementation decisions and acceptance gates are already consolidated in this repository.

| Supporting material | Existing location |
| --- | --- |
| Assignment brief and extracted text | `../reference/Kivi_Golden_Goose_Task_Final.pdf` and `.txt` |
| Eight synthetic source observations | `../reference-examples/sample-dictations.jsonl` |
| Separate evaluator questions/labels | `../reference-examples/sample-evaluation-cases.json` — never ingest as memory |
| Deeper implementation research | `../research/implementation-strategy.md`, `implementation-evaluation.md`, `implementation-models.md` |
| Educational memory blueprint | `../kivi-memory-blueprint.html` |

S05 copied and hash-verified the [eight observations](data/synthetic/sample-dictations.jsonl) and [separate evaluator labels](eval/fixtures/sample-evaluation-cases.json). Fresh clones include both; only the JSONL is source input. These eight observations do not satisfy the approximately 500-observation corpus requirement. The course and research artifacts remain background references.

## Proposed starting stack

| Need | Technology | Why this is enough initially |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Consistent runtime | Ubuntu 24.04 / WSL2, Docker Compose, containerized Python 3.12 | A Linux execution path without changing host Python or requiring deployment. |
| HTTP API and typed boundaries | FastAPI, Pydantic, HTTPX | Small API, validated request/model output contracts and a provider adapter. |
| State and retrieval | PostgreSQL + pgvector; built-in full-text search | One database for sources, claims, revisions, jobs and searchable views. Exact vectors before ANN. |
| DB access and schema changes | SQLAlchemy, psycopg, Alembic | Explicit transactions and reproducible migrations. |
| Optional developer CLI | Typer calling the same application services | Diagnostics and automation through the same services; ordinary-user actions use the browser. |
| Reproducible checks | pytest, HTTPX test client, Ruff, locked dependencies with uv | Cheap contract tests plus separately identified real-model evaluation. |
| Ordinary-user surface | Small HTML/CSS/JavaScript client served by FastAPI | Import, Sources, Search, processing/status, Memories/history, Ask, Correct/world-change/Forget, feedback and Normal/Private switching. No separate frontend server/build step. |

The S03 backend versions are now resolved in `uv.lock` and image digests are pinned in Dockerfile/Compose; retrieval and Ask/control implementations are covered by the current acceptance record. Browser tests use an optional separately locked Playwright dependency; end users need neither Node nor Python installed. No Redis, separate vector service, graph cluster, autonomous memory framework or Kubernetes is required for the first implementation.

## What must be demonstrated

1. Original records become selective, source-supported memories; raw and formatted variants stay one observation.
2. Information spread across dictations can support a useful answer or draft with citations.
3. Changed facts, tentative statements and conflicting evidence produce different behavior.
4. Correct changes later use; Forget prevents retrieval and relearning; Private neither reads saved personal data nor persists activity.
5. A reviewer can import an unfamiliar corpus, inspect actual state, operate the UI and reproduce evaluation.

Approximately 500 development observations and a separate reviewer corpus of approximately 500 are required. Eight synthetic Atlas examples in the planning workspace are the starting diagnostic cases, not the complete dataset. The user now selected **Kimi K3** as the S06 response candidate, replacing DeepSeek; [the current shortlist](ARCHITECTURE.md#models-and-repair) compares NVIDIA Nemotron Lightning and Qwen3-8B for memory proposals. Exact model performance, provider access, spend ceiling and retention settings must be verified before live calls.

## History, evidence and AI use

Commit `596b034` replaced the earlier repository contents with a focused planning baseline. Prior commits remain reachable through normal Git history. After each meaningful milestone, run relevant checks, update [todo.md](todo.md), commit and push the completed work. Neither timestamps nor results should be manufactured to suggest progress.

These technical documents were prepared with AI assistance, including explainer agents, source research and review. The assignment's **Part One positioning and vision must be independently formed and written by the applicant and preserved before Part Two**. The applicant's supplied [source notes](docs/part-one/README.md) are preserved with provenance and counts; the applicant now reports the final documents complete and held separately. They have not been inspected or mechanically checked in this checkout. The applicant explicitly approved S03 proceeding on that basis. These technical documents do not fulfill Part One. Do not generate replacement positioning or vision text.

Azure is an optional final experiment after the local review path passes. It is not a dependency of submission. The architecture and evaluation are hypotheses to test, not claims of a best-performing memory system.
